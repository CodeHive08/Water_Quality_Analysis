# Water_Quality_Analysis

This project aims to predict the **potability of water** using machine learning algorithms based on various water quality parameters.

---

## üìÇ Dataset

The dataset used in this project is `water_potability.csv`.The link to the dataset is:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityakadiwal/water-potability  
It includes the following water quality metrics:

- pH
- Hardness
- Solids
- Chloramines
- Sulfate
- Conductivity
- Organic Carbon
- Trihalomethanes
- Turbidity
- **Potability** (Target Variable: 0 = Not Potable, 1 = Potable)

## üìå Project Overview

The project follows a structured machine learning pipeline:

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**  
   Load the dataset and inspect its structure, size, and initial statistics.

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   Handle missing values (notably in `ph`, `Sulfate`, and `Trihalomethanes`) using imputation strategies based on the `Potability` class.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   Visualize data distributions, correlations, and missing value patterns to gain insights.

4. **Feature Selection and Target Variable**  
   Define independent features (X) and the dependent target variable (y).

5. **Data Splitting**  
   Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80-20 split).

6. **Feature Scaling**  
   Normalize the features using `StandardScaler` to bring them to a common scale.

7. **Model Training**  
   Train a **Random Forest Classifier** on the training data.

8. **Hyperparameter Tuning**  
   Use `RandomizedSearchCV` to optimize the performance of the Random Forest model.

9. **Model Evaluation**  
   Evaluate model performance using:
   - Accuracy Score
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Classification Report

10. **Prediction on Sample Input**  
    Demonstrate model prediction for new, unseen data.

11. **XGBoost Classifier**  
    Train and evaluate an **XGBoost Classifier** to compare results with the Random Forest.
